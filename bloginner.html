    <p>The printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <br>
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more<br>
         recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <p>But because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter extremely painful<br>
             consequences. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is<br>
              pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some<br>
               great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,<br>
             except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy<br>
              a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

        <p>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is<br>
             untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be <br>
             welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations<br>
              of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man<br>
             therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater<br>
              pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
